            <h1 style="text-align: center;">Terms and Conditions</h1>
            <p>By availing <strong>Mission's Shoe Restoration service</strong>, you agree to the following terms and conditions:</p>
            <p>1. You may cancel the shoe restoration service at any time before the process begins. However, any downpayment made will not be refunded after work has started, as it covers the assessment and materials required for the restoration.</p>
            <p>2. Sole Mission is not responsible for any damage or loss that occurs during delivery by a third- party courier service, either to or from our facility. It is the customer's responsibility to ensure that shoes are properly packed and insured during shipment. We recommend using a reliable courier service with tracking and insurance. Sole Mission also offers pickup and delivery services with fee, available for a limited area only.</p>
            <p>3. If the shoes are not picked up within 2 months from the completion of the restoration, Sole Mission reserves the right to dispose of or sell the shoes without returning the downpayment to the owner. We will notify you before this action is taken.</p>
            <p>4. While we take all necessary precautions to protect your shoes, we are not liable for any damage that occurs during the restoration process due to the current condition of the shoes. This includes any pre-existing damage, wear, or fragility that may affect the restoration. However, if damage occurs due to our negligence during the restoration process, we will conduct an investigation and take appropriate corrective actions.</p>
            <p>5. While we strive to restore your shoes to their best possible condition, Sole Mission does not guarantee a factory-finish result. The final output may vary due to the existing condition of the shoes and the nature of the restoration process.</p>

                above terms and conditions.</p>

            <p>2. An assessment will be conducted once your pair(s) are received. If additional repairs or services are required, they will be discussed with you and must be approved before proceeding.</p>
            <p>3. The estimated processing time for the sole reglue service is 7-14 business days from the date your pair(s) are received and assessed. Processing times may vary depending on the condition of the shoes and workload.</p>
            <p>4. A 50% downpayment is required from the date your pair(s) are received and assessed. The reglue process will commence once the downpayment has been made. The remaining balance must be settled upon completion, before pickup or delivery.</p>
            <p>5. While we strive to ensure the best possible repair, further damage may occur during the reglue process, especially if the shoe is already significantly worn or damaged. Sole Mission will notify you immediately if any issues are noticed before proceeding further. However, if damage occurs due to our negligence during the service, an investigation will be conducted, and appropriate corrective actions will be taken.</p>
            <p>6. Sole Mission offers a 6-month warranty on the sole reglue service. If the sole detaches within 6 months of the service, we will provide a free reglue repair. However, the longevity of the repair depends on the shoe's condition, use, and care after the service. This warranty does not cover damage caused by improper use, excessive wear, or neglect.</p>
            <p>7. Sole Mission will notify you once your pair(s) are ready for pickup or delivery. If the shoes are not collected within 2 days from the notification date, a charge of P30.00 per pair per day will apply.</p>
